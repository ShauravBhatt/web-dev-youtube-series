# WebDev YouTube Series 🚀

Welcome to the **WebDev YouTube Series** repository! 🎥🌐  
This repo is a step-by-step guide to my full-stack web development journey. It contains all the code and projects I’ve built while learning and teaching web development through my YouTube playlist.

## What's This Journey About?  

I’m learning and building projects starting from the basics of web development and moving toward advanced topics. My goal is to make learning easier for everyone by sharing clear and structured resources. Here's what I’m covering:

### 1. HTML  
The foundation of web pages. Learn all important tags and how to structure content properly.  

### 2. CSS  
The styling part! Understand layouts, colors, animations, and responsive designs to make websites look amazing.  

### 3. JavaScript (Coming Soon)  
Add interactivity to your pages. From simple scripts to advanced functionalities.  

### 4. Front-End Frameworks (Planned)  
Learn tools like **Tailwind CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **React** to build modern, fast, and scalable front-end applications.  

### 5. Back-End Development (Future Plans)  
Dive into server-side programming with **Node.js** and **Express.js** to handle data and build APIs.  

### 6. Databases  
Learn how to work with databases like **MongoDB** to store and manage data efficiently.  

### 7. Full-Stack Projects  
Combine everything to create real-world full-stack applications!
